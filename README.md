## Abstract
	This project is created so you can choose a meal item, or an entire meal and have
  the site randomly generate those items for you so you're not stuck trying to decide
  on what to have for dinner. You can choose between a side, a main dish, a dessert, or
  an entire meal. You'll be able to clear your selection and reselect something else.

## Wins
  - The JavaScript came out pretty well. I'm happy with how seamless it felt writing it.

    upon it.
